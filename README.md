==Battle Ball Project

===Notes

To run the battleball project under unity, and use a mobile controller, you'll need to open port 8080 in your firewall for in and out request with UDP protocol.

When using the battle ball app (.exe) Windows will ask to authorize application. Say yes or you won't be able to use a mobile controller.
